This will be a website that will have a search engine that works. It will pull any link in the internet, put it in a list, and then searches 
the list for any occurance of every word you typed in that list and displays the most relevant results


The way it displays  relevant results is that if there is more occurance in a link, then it will display more at the top of the results

The for loop also has variables considered like the synonym of each word.
